"The effect of physical multimorbidity, mental health conditions and socioeconomic deprivation on unplanned admissions to hospital: a retrospective cohort study.(Research)",Canadian Medical Association,2013,"Background: Multimorbidity, the presence of more than 1 long-term disorder, is associated with increased use of health services, but unplanned admissions to hospital may often be undesirable. Furthermore, socioeconomic deprivation and mental health comorbidity may lead to additional unplanned admissions. We examined the association between unplanned admission to hospital and physical multimorbidity, mental health and socioeconomic deprivation. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 180 815 patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with 40 general practices in Scotland. Details of 32 physical and 8 mental health morbidities were extracted from the patients' electronic health records (as of Apr. 1, 2006) and linked to hospital admission data. We then recorded the occurrence of unplanned or potentially preventable unplanned acute (nonpsychiatric) admissions to hospital in the subsequent 12 months. We used logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex, to determine associations between unplanned or potentially preventable unplanned admissions to hospital and physical multimorbidity, mental health and socioeconomic deprivation. Results: We identified 10 828 (6.0%) patients who had at least 1 unplanned admission to hospital and 2037 (1.1%) patients who had at least 1 potentially preventable unplanned admission to hospital. Both unplanned and potentially preventable unplanned admissions were independently associated with increasing physical multimorbidity (for [greater than or equal to] 4 v. 0 conditions, odds ratio [OR] 5.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.45-6.32] for unplanned admissions, OR 14.38 [95% CI 1 1.87-17.43] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions), mental health conditions (for [greater than or equal to] 1 v. 0 conditions, OR 2.01 [95% CI 1.92-2.09] for unplanned admissions, OR 1.80 [95% CI 1.64-1.97] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions) and socioeconomic deprivation (for most v. least deprived quintile, OR 1.56 [95% CI 1.43-1.70] for unplanned admissions, OR 1.98 [95% CI 1.63-2.41] for potentially preventable unplanned admissions). Interpretation: Physical multimorbidity was strongly associated with unplanned admission to hospital, including admissions that were potentially preventable. The risk of admission to hospital was exacerbated by the coexistence of mental health conditions and socioeconomic deprivation.

Residents with mental-physical multimorbidity living in long-term care facilities: prevalence and characteristics. A systematic review,International Psychogeriatrics ,2013," Background: Aging societies will be confronted with increased numbers of long-term care (LTC) residents with multimorbidity of physical and mental disorders other than dementia. Knowledge about the prevalence rates, medical and psychosocial characteristics, and care needs of this particular group of residents is mandatory for providing high-quality and evidence-based care. The purpose of this paper was to review the literature regarding these features. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from January 1, 1988 to August 16, 2011. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of studies on pre-established inclusion criteria as well as methodological quality using standardized checklists. Results: Seventeen articles were included. Only one small study describes multimorbidity of a wide range of chronic psychiatric and somatic conditions in LTC residents and suggests that physical-mental multimorbidity is rather rule than exception. All other studies show prevalence rates of comorbid physical and mental illnesses (range, 0.5%-64.7%), roughly in line with reported prevalence rates among community-dwelling older people. LTC residents with mental-physical multimorbidity were younger than other LTC residents and had more cognitive impairment, no dementia, and problem behaviors. Care needs of these residents were not described. Conclusions: Although exact figures are lacking, mental-physical multimorbidity is common in LTC residents. Given the specific characteristics of the pertaining residents, more knowledge of their specific care needs is essential. The first step now should be to perform research on symptoms and behavior, which seem more informative than diagnostic labels as well as care needs of LTC residents with mental-physical multimorbidity.","LTC residents with mental-physical multimorbidity were younger, had more cognitive impairments and problem behaviours; Mental-physical multimorbidity is common in LTC residents.

The influence of socioeconomic deprivation on multimorbidity at different ages: a cross-sectional study,British journal of general practice,2014,Aim: to characterize multimorbidity type and most common conditions in a large nationally representative primary care dataset in terms of age and deprivation ,Mixed physical and mental morbidity is associated with SES,github.com/AhmadMobin/MultiMorbidity_CIHI/raw/master/bjgpjul2014-64-624-e440-oa.pdf
How Does Sex Influence Multimorbidity? Secondary Analysis of a Large Nationally Representative Dataset,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2016,"Multimorbidity increases with age and is generally more common in women, but little is known about sex effects on the “typology” of multimorbidity. We have characterized multimorbidity in a large nationally representative primary care dataset in terms of sex in ten year age groups from 25 years to 75 years and over, in a cross-sectional analysis of multimorbidity type (physical-only, mental-only, mixed physical and mental; and commonest conditions) for 1,272,685 adults in Scotland. Our results show that women had more multimorbidity overall in every age group, which was most pronounced in the 45–54 years age group (women 26.5% vs. men 19.6%; difference 6.9 (95% CI 6.5 to 7.2). From the age of 45, physical-only multimorbidity was consistently more common in men, and physical-mental multimorbidity more common in women. The biggest difference in physical-mental multimorbidity was found in the 75 years and over group (women 30.9% vs. men 21.2%; difference 9.7 (95% CI 9.1 to 10.2). The commonest condition in women was depression until the age of 55 years, thereafter hypertension. In men, drugs misuse had the highest prevalence in those aged 25–34 years, depression for those aged 35–44 years, and hypertension for 45 years and over. Depression, pain, irritable bowel syndrome and thyroid disorders were more common in women than men across all age groups. We conclude that the higher overall prevalence of multimorbidity in women is mainly due to more mixed physical and mental health problems. The marked difference between the sexes over 75 years especially warrants further investigation.",The biggest difference in physical-mental multimorbidity was found in the 75 years and over group; Higher overall prevalence of multimorbidity in women is mainly due to more mixed physical and mental health problems,github.com/AhmadMobin/MultiMorbidity_CIHI/raw/master/ijerph-13-00391.pdf
Non-adherence to antihypertensive medication: The role of mental and physical comorbidity,International Journal of Cardiology,2016,"Multiple parameters influence adherence to drug treatment, including socio-economic, healthcare, condition, therapy, and patient-related factors. However, studies of the impact of patient-related factors, particularly regarding comorbid conditions, have produced conflicting results.

Objectives

To analyse the association between mental and physical comorbidity and non-adherence to antihypertensive medication in patients attending primary care, after including a comprehensive range of chronic comorbidities and potential confounders.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of 113,397 adults with a diagnosis of hypertension in 2010 assigned to the public health service of a region in northeastern Spain. Pharmacy billing records were linked to data from electronic health records at individual level. Non-adherence was defined as an antihypertensive medication possession ratio (MPR) < 80%. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio for non-adherence. Potential predictors included mental and physical comorbidity, age, sex, blood pressure level, nationality, rurality, polypharmacy, and number of visits to the GP and to different specialties.

Results

One fifth of the study population showed poor adherence levels. Female sex, younger age, foreign nationality, living in a rural area, low blood pressure levels, polypharmacy, and mental comorbidity were positively and significantly associated with non-adherence. Conversely, non-adherence was negatively and significantly associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and higher annual rates of GP visits.

Conclusion

The majority of patient-related determinants identified here (e.g., the presence of mental comorbidity, polypharmacy, foreign nationality) underscores the need for a patient- rather than a disease-centred care approach, as well as adequate physician-patient communication.",Mental comorbidity were positively associated with non-adherence,github.com/AhmadMobin/MultiMorbidity_CIHI/blob/master/1-s2.0-S0167527316300328-main.pdf
Challenges of managing people with multimorbidity in today’s healthcare systems,BMC family practice,2015,"Multimorbidity is a growing issue and poses a major challenge to health care systems around the world. Multimorbidity is related to ageing but many studies have now shown that it is also socially patterned, being more common and occurring at an earlier age in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. There is lack of research on patients with multimorbidity, and thus guidelines are based on single-conditions. Polypharmacy is common in multimorbidity, increasing drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. Multimorbid patients need holistic care, but secondary care services are highly specialised and thus are often duplicative and fragmented and thus increase treatment burden in multimorbid patients. The cost of care is high in multimorbidity, due to high rates of primary and secondary care consultations and unplanned hospital admissions. The combination of mental and physical conditions increases complexity of care, and costs. Mental-physical multimorbidity is especially common in deprived areas. General practitioners and primary care teams have a key role in managing patients with multimorbidity, using a patient-centred generalist approach. Consultation length and continuity of care may need to be substantially enhanced in order to enable such patients. This will require a radical change in how health care systems are organised and funded in order to effectively meet the challenges of multimorbidity.","The combination of mental and physical conditions increases complexity of care, and costs.

"Depression and Multimorbidity- a cross-sectional study of 1,751,841 patients in primary care",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2014,"Depression is common in many chronic physical health disorders, but the nature and extent of physical health comorbidities in depression, particularly within large population-based samples of patients, and how these comorbidities relate to factors such as age, sex, and social deprivation, are unknown. We aimed to assess the nature and extent of multiple physical health comorbidities in primary care patients with depression within a large and representative Scottish dataset. This study was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of 314 primary care practices in Scotland (from the Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, March 31, 2007), including 143,943 people with depression and 1,280,435 controls. The outcomes assessed were 32 common chronic physical health conditions, adjusted for age, sex, and social deprivation. Depression was defined as a Read code for depression recorded within last year and/or 4 or more antidepressant prescriptions (excluding low-dose tricyclic antidepressants) within the last year. Individuals in primary care with depression were more likely than individuals without depression to have every one of the 32 comorbid physical conditions we assessed, even after adjusting for age, sex, and deprivation. The depression group was also significantly more likely to have multiple levels of comorbidity, including 2 physical health conditions (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.53-1.58), 3 physical health conditions (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.81-1.87), 4 physical health conditions (OR = 2.06; 95% CI, 2.01-2.11; P < .001), and 5 or more physical health conditions (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 2.59-2.71; P < .001). Depression in primary care is associated with a very wide range of physical health comorbidities and considerable medical burden. The nature and extent of this multimorbidity and the important association with social deprivation have not been previously described within a large and representative dataset of routine primary care data. Our findings have important implications for the integrated management of depression and physical health problems in the United Kingdom and throughout the world.
